# Make sure your code is at the latest version:
cd gui-agent-banking-assistant
git pull origin main

# Installation:
cd gui-agent-banking-assistant         # Step into your project directory
python -m venv venv                    # Create a virtual environment (only ONCE)
source venv/bin/activate               # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt        # Install all dependencies (only ONCE, or after changes)

# To run the server (every time you start working):
source venv/bin/activate               # Activate the virtual environment (if not already)
uvicorn main:app --reload              # Start the FastAPI server (auto-reloads on code changes) then go to 127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html

# To switch between Alex (tutor) and Sam (teller):
1. For EVERY .html file (including those in /etransfer, /pay_bill, /statement), comment out one <iframe>
For example, to enable tutorbot Alex:
<iframe src="../tutorbot.html" class="chatbot-frame"></iframe>
<!-- <iframe src="../tellerbot.html" class="chatbot-frame"></iframe> -->
2. Precheck every page in that task and make sure the bot is the correct one. If not, command+shift+R to refresh and clean the cache.

# After finishing each task:
Need to close the tab and reopen the page to reset the bot state.

# Authentication errors may from the following sources:
* Endpoint are the shorter one
* double check deployment_name
* load_dotenv(override=True)
